This is an Atari Combat clone that I created while learning to code!  This is not meant for sale and all original ideas
belong to the Atari Combat team.

All files needed for the game are included here except for the Pygame framework.  This was built using Python 2.7 and
the Pygame 1.9 framework.  These can be found at python.org and pygame.org respectively.
